# Craxsrat-IP-Extractor
Python script to extract C2 IP from CraxsRAT's client APK

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- **JADX command line**: The script relies on JADX to decompile APK files. You need to download and install JADX from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/skylot/jadx). Make sure it's added to your system's PATH.

## Usage
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fareedfauzi/craxsrat-ip-extractor.git
$ cd craxsrat-ip-extractor
$ python3 craxsrat_ip_extractor.py /path/to/apk/folder
```
